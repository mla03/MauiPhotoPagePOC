Proof of Concept with two pages, services and viewmodels. 
Page 1 Creates a job, if not already there. Pressing the "Go To PhotoPage!" will navigate user to the PhotoPage. 
Add photos to the Photo Page and navigate back and forth between Job page and PhotoPage, with 8-15 Photos added, the app will crash on iOS after navigating back and forth 10-20 times. 
First the photos starts to turn white, and after few more tries, the app crashes.
